#  A stripped-down version of the original yaml template source by Aleksandr

#  Original Yaml template source: Aleksandr Mattal, qute.bits@gmail.com,

#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   GENERAL GUIDELINES from the original author Aleksandr Mattal:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# -   If you change the name of any section in 'order' list (example: you
#     rename "PORTFOLIO" into "STUFF"), remember that you also have to change
#     that name in the "resume-section.tmpl.tex".
#
# -   Quote the strings with : or - because these are YAML special chars.
#
# -   Avoid / symbol - it spoils the height of some fonts
#
# -   If _ (underscore) is needed in PDF: TeX needs \_ so you write \\_ in YAML
#     because YAML converts \\ to \
#
# -   If _ is a part of url - put the whole url into \url{} brackets in TeX
#     cause otherwise "www.let.it/be_good/" will compile to "www.let.it/be" in
#     PDF on hover
#
# -   COMPILE TWICE when done - needed by TeX to get the lastpage number right.
